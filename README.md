Project Overview ğŸ“‹
This project is a part of our Bayesian Statistics course at Chaminade University of Honolulu. Weâ€™re diving into Renewable Energy Forecasting in Spain ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸, applying Bayesian techniques to analyze and predict energy trends. By examining Spainâ€™s energy demand and renewable generation potential, this project aims to provide insights into the sustainability of energy sources and their future supply-demand dynamics.

Project Objectives ğŸ“Š ğŸ“ˆ ğŸ“‰
Our main goals are:

Plot and analyze the distribution of total energy demand in Spain.
Identify potential predictors for energy demand within our dataset.
Explore predictors for solar and wind energy generation to determine their viability.
Forecast renewable energy supply versus total energy demand to evaluate potential gaps and understand Spainâ€™s energy sustainability.
Data Source ğŸ“‚
Our data comes from Kaggle, containing renewable energy and weather data for various cities in Spain. We focus on Barcelona, applying Bayesian methods to predict and analyze energy generation and demand patterns.
